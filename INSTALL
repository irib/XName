XName Database 
===================

- edit sql/creation.sql
	change database name xnamedev for xname - or whatever name you want -
	in the two first lines
- run sql code
	$ mysql -upoweruser -p < sql/creation.sql


XName web interface
===================

- edit html/libs/config.php
	change all items accordingly with your site configuration
- edit html/disclaimer.php
	change the disclaimer text to your one
- be sure to have following programs available in your path:
	dig named-checkzone host

If you want to use your own design instead of XName.org's one,
simply change each html/*.php file, accordingly 
with html/libs/html.php where original functions where present.
html/libs/html.php class & functions are used only in html/*.php files.


XName DNS file generator & log insert
======================================

Firstly, you have to install bind. Tested on v9.2.1.

- edit /etc/named.conf, configure general options, suppress eventually 
everything at the end concerning local zones. 
You have now a clean named header file. Just copy it into /etc/bind/headers
or somewhere else (to be configured in bin/generate.pl).

- edit bin/generate.pl, bin/insertlogs.pl and bin/delete.pl, modify vars.

- modify crontab
Add in crontab a line for insertlogs.pl, every 10 mn
Add a crontab line for delete.pl, every hour 
Add a crontab line for generate.pl, every hour 5 mn after delete.pl

/etc/crontab sample:
# XNAME
*/10 *  * * *   root    /home/xname/bin/insertlogs.pl
30 *   * * *   root    /home/xname/bin/delete.pl
35 *    * * *   root    /home/xname/bin/generate.pl
